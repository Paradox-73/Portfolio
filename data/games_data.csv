The game uses basics from the hack-and-slash genre, like its predecessor, and was developed by Santa Monica studio, which is a subsidiary of Sony Entertainment. The game is recognized as one of the best for the console from Sony and the best game in action genre in 2007. The game was released on Sony Playstation 2 already at the moment when the third version of the console was already selling for four months. The developers explained their decision: one hundred million people already playing on PlayStation 2, whereas on the next-generation console gamers were just going to adopt the new hardware.

###Key features
The player controls Kratos, who in the first part killed the god of war Ares and took his place. The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.

###The story
King of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies. The game has a lot of Quick-Time-Events, mostly they are used in battles with bosses and in finishing combo-moves. Bosses in the game, in comparison with the first part, significantly increased."

ambush against Tony and claimed him as their prisoner. Armed with Stark
Industries weaponry, Tony’s new foes demanded he construct a new
ultimate weapon for them. Instead, with the help of fellow captive
Yinsen, Tony built his own ultimate weapon – a powerful suit of armor
that served as the key to his heroic escape.

After returning home, Tony’s near-death experience drastically altered
his outlook on life. The attack against Tony – with his own creations,
no less – inspired him to cease production of all Stark Industries
weapons, despite the protests of longtime family

friend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn’t all. Aided by his

###Plot
The game is set in Gotham City. A group of supervillains once again escaped the ever unreliable Arkham Asylum. They formed three separate gangs led by Batman’s arch-enemies Joker, Riddler, and Penguin, respectively. Each gang has a chapter of the game dedicated to it. Riddler’s plan is to rob Gotham's gold reserves. Penguin is going to use his robotic minions to conquer Gotham. Joker wants to poison the whole city with his laughing gas. Batman and Robin have to disrupt the villains’ plans.

###Gameplay
The game is divided into the heroes’ and villains’ missions. In the heroes’ missions, you play as Batman or his aides Robin, Batgirl, and Nightwing, while the playable villains change over the course of the game. Between missions, the characters reside in their respective hubs, Batcave and Arkham Asylum. Each character has his or her unique abilities, such as special weapons, double jumps, mind control or immunity to certain attacks. The player can also change the suits of the characters to use their specific effects. For example, a Glide suit allows Batman to fly short distances, while Robin can use Magnet suit to climb metal surfaces.

Also, it was one of the first game to be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. These versions of FIFA 14 feature a new game engine Ignite. This engine features both graphical and gameplay enchantments. The game also features an improved AI mechanic which created a much more realistic game of football with every player in the stadium being as much realistic as possible. But not only, the players became more realistic as the weather effects became more believable too as well as the crowd which responds in anything that happens on the stadium.

###Gameplay 
Almost every Need For Speed game features the same gameplay features, and Undercover is no different. There is an open world which is permitted to discover at any time in contrary with, for instance, Most Wanted, where the environment was zoned, and the locations opened as the story progressed.
The car collisions system has become more realistic compared to the previous parts of the game, but damage remained cosmetic only with no impact on performance. However, the car may be destroyed in Highway Battle — one of the game mods. 
The title features some RPG elements — wheelman points, which grants the player access to bonus levels and car parts. 
The police in the game are traced by the bar at the top of the screen varying between Busted and Evade modes. The capturing of the player results in the checkpoint restart.

###Plot 
The game's title suggests the protagonist role in the story — he is an undercover police agent given a task to infiltrate the group of street-racers to expose them to arrest. The background behind the races is taking down the criminal gangs and cliques. During the narrative player is faced with some dilemmas demanding a hard choice of him on which side to take."

###Plot
The game introduces Spider-Man as an already experienced superhero. By the time the game begins, Peter has captured the infamous Kingpin as well as several other supervillains. Now, a gang that goes by the name of Demons poses a new danger to New York. Meanwhile, Peter is working for the scientist Otto Octavius, who didn't yet become Dr. Octopus, on their science project. Throughout the game, Spidey has to deal with multiple enemies, such as Norman Osbourne, Electro, Vulture, Rhino and Kingpin, among others.

###Gameplay
The player controls Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, from the third person view. There are also sections of the game in which the player controls other protagonists, namely Mary Jane and Miles Morales. The game is set in a 3D environment that is modeled after New York City. The player can travel the city using web slings, running, jumping, and crawling the walls. The setting includes numerous high-rise buildings designed specifically for Spider-Man's movements.

As the player progresses, he or she unlocks new suits that grant Spider-Man new abilities, such as additional attacks or enhanced Spider-Sense. The abilities are not tied to the suits, however, and the player can use the suit of his or her choice without losing the ability. The combat system is similar to that in Batman: Arkham, in that Spider-Man fights many opponents in hand-to-hand combat but avoids killing them."

Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. 

His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. 

Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. 

From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. 

With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre"

Play online or over local wifi with 4-10 players as you attempt to hold your spaceship together and return back to civilization. But beware...as there may be an alien impostor aboard!

One crewmate has been replaced by a parasitic shapeshifter. Their goal is to eliminate the rest of the crew before the ship reaches home. The Impostor will sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, deceive, and frame others to remain anonymous and kill off the crew.

While everyone is fixing up the ship, no one can talk to maintain anonymity. Once a body is reported, the surviving crew will openly debate who they think The Impostor is. The Impostor's goal is to pretend that they are a member of the crew. If The Impostor is not voted off, everyone goes back to maintaining the ship until another body is found.

Angry Birds 2 starts a new era of addictive slingshot gameplay with stunning graphics, challenging multi-stage levels, scheming boss pigs and even more destruction.

**Angry Birds 2 is optimized for iPhone 5, iPad 3, iPad mini 2 and iPod Touch 5G or newer. You can try it on older devices, but we can't guarantee a smooth bird flinging experience!

CHOOSE YOUR BIRD!
It’s the ultimate slingshot action strategy – YOU choose which bird to fling next! “But that makes it easier, right?” WRONG! You’ll need to choose wisely if you’re going to stop those eggs from getting scrambled. Plus, crush those pigs and blocks to fill up the Destruct-O-Meter and earn extra birds!
NEW MULTI-STAGE LEVELS!
You’ve never seen Piggy Island like this – jaw-droppingly stunning levels brimming with exotic plants, quirky details, fun animations and plenty of peril. Those naughty porkies are now experts at building physics defying towers: levels now have multiple stages for an added challenge. Uh oh.
SPECTACULAR SPELLS!
Blizzards, Hot Chilis, Golden Ducks and other outrageous spells give you an added advantage against those swindling swine. And when you need some serious help, guess who’s at hand to make a pork-smashing cameo? That’s right, it’s the sardine loving Mighty Eagle. Oh yeah!
CHALLENGE OTHER PLAYERS!
Challenge players from across the world in the Arena to see who’s the best bird flinger of them all! Connect to Facebook and play new tournaments every day to earn feathers and level-up your flock. In the Arena you play until you run out of birds and spells, so get out there and solve the puzzles – you’re only up against the rest of the planet.

DEFEAT BOSS PIGGIES!
There’s some serious bad guys on Piggy Island, and your slingshot skills are needed to take them down. Foreman Pig, Chef Pig and the infamous King Pig will stop at nothing to keep your eggs. Are you gonna let ‘em get away with that? It’s time to hit that pork and teach ‘em a lesson.

Plot

The game follows Ellie, the girl who was the secondary protagonist and the player character's companion in The Last of Us. The game is set five years after the ending of the original. Both Ellie (who is by 19 now) and Joel survived and live in Jackson, Wyoming, where Ellie is dating another girl, Dina. However, the characters have to deal with the evil cult called the Seraphites, who try to sacrifice their former members. A matter of revenge forces Ellie and her friends to undertake a trip to Seattle, Washington, to kill their enemies. The major theme of the plot is Ellie's dealing with her hate issues.

Gameplay

Unlike in the original game, the player controls Ellie instead of Joel, who now becomes her AI-controlled companion. The game features improved controls that include new options such as crawling, dodging, and a jump button. A new AI system allows the human adversaries to communicate share information with each other. The game also introduces multiplayer."

Her Story also is an interactive movie video game which is written and directed by Sam Barlow. Her Story is about a man who is missing and the player has to focus on searching through databases of various video clips from police interviews with missing mans wife Hannah Smith, in order to solve a case.

Her Story is the first game made by Sam Barlow since his departure from Climax Studios. He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.
The game was praised because of its original narrative, character performance and interesting gameplay mechanics."
