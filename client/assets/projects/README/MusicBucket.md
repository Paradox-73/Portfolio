- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW (Mock Service Worker), Cypress
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 🔄 Git Setup for Collaborators

### Getting Started with the Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MusicBucket.git
   cd MusicBucket
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with necessary API keys (Spotify, MapBox, Supabase) as per `.env.example`.

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Contributing
1. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge your changes to the main branch

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive information like API keys or secrets
- All environment variables should be set in the .env file which is ignored by git
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Reach out to the project maintainer if you need access to API keys for development
